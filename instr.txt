Everything within Elise’s instructions should be incorporated into my instructions by now so hopefully you’ll only need to reference one document.
The onboarding tracker for the Houston Hub: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XbOBsNZ8EBtpIhldJvhUyLKxySrMVf3KN3FhZfUjcvg/edit
This also serves as the Houston Hub member list. I can only share members’ personal information with you because Elise has authorized you. Please do not share members’ data with anyone else.
This document has two tabs. The first tab is the member list aka folks who have been onboarded since I restarted the Houston Hub recently. The second tab is the list of people still onboarding. This is where we can keep track of who’s been contacted and any notes we want to remember for ourselves or share with each other in terms of further attempts at contacting folks. I also use this as a quick cheat sheet while on the call so I don’t forget what to ask them.
